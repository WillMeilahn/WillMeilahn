- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WillMeilahn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Music Production, Video Games, and anything outdoors.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... You can't. I'm a ghost. Just kidding! If you want to get in touch with me, you're going to need to find me in the wild or simply email me at meilahnwa@gmail.com. If you are going to email me, keep it semi-professional.

Other useful information:
- Ex-Army Infantry, wanted to be a Ranger but got medically discharged before I got the chance to try.
- Eagle Scout (Highest Rank in Boy Scouts)
