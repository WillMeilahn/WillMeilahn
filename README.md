- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillMeilahn
- 👀 I’m interested in Music production, Video Games and anything outdoors. (unless it's yard work)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic computer science and how to program AR and VR games and other applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my school work... it's hard. ;-;
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can't, i'm a ghost. Just kidding, if you want to get in contact with me you're going to need to find me in the wild.

Other useful information:
- Ex-Army Infantry, Airborne, Air Assualt, wanted to be a Ranger but got medically discharged before I got the chance to try.
- Eagle Scout (Highest Rank in Boy Scouts)
