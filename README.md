- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillMeilahn
- 👀 I’m interested in Music Production, Video Games, and anything outdoors. (unless it's yard work)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic computer science and how to program AR and VR games and applications at Holberton School Tulsa.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my school work or my passion project. (contact me for the details)
- 📫 How to reach me... you can't. I'm a ghost. Just kidding! If you want to get in touch with me you're going to need to find me in the wild or simply email me at meilahnwa@gmail.com If you are going to email me, keep it semi-professional
