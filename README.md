- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillMeilahn
- 👀 I’m interested in Music Production, Video Games, and anything outdoors. (unless it's yard work)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic computer science and how to program AR and VR games and applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my school work... it's hard. ;-;
- 📫 How to reach me... you can't, I'm a ghost. Just kidding, if you want to get in contact with me you're going to need to find me in the wild or email me: meilahnwa@gmail.com
